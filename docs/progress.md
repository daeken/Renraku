# Renraku progress and next work

As of October 28, 2026, the core process crash-and-resume demonstration, managed
strings, and persistent local model harness work. CIL is the execution foundation for all
persistent guest computation. External programs will require explicit capabilities
and do not inherit persistence.

## Implemented

- Rust CIL loader and interpreter, custom Roslyn CoreLib, explicit portable frames,
  object identity, fields, inheritance, loops, nested calls, and static storage.
- Atomic SQLite checkpoints, code and identity binding recovery, schema and stack
  validation, optimistic generation checks, named roots, and tracing collection.
- Process kill tests with a cyclic object graph and nested frames. The durable
  simulation returns 5526 and the first demo returns 48 in 155 instructions.
- UTF-16 literals, immutable string objects, Char slots, length, indexing,
  concatenation, equality, and persistent literal interning. String intrinsics
  are whitelisted InternalCall methods and are atomic guest steps.
- Host effect outbox with stable IDs, prepared/in-flight/uncertain/completed
  states, GC retention, and atomic intent/dispatch and response checkpoints.
- Deterministic local echo provider with a separate durable receipt ledger.
  Reconciliation never falls back to submission; completed work is not resent.
- Queue, dispatch, reconcile, and inspect CLI commands. A CIL method consumes a
  stored response as an ordinary managed string in the integration suite.
- CIL `Renraku.Model.Complete` with portable AwaitEffect frames, waiting status,
  and atomic response + result stack + runnable continuation checkpoints.
  New model calls default to disabled on every fresh VM and restore; use
  `set_model_calls_enabled(true)` or trailing CLI `--allow-model-calls`.
- Linked C# conversation with two model calls and four messages. It returns 417
  after 158 guest instructions, matching the CoreCLR echo reference shim.
- Bounded `Vm::drive_model` and `drive-local` CLI coordinate checkpointed execution,
  prepared dispatch, and uncertain receipt lookup. Explicit per-invocation
  instruction and provider-operation budgets include zero budgets. Missing
  receipts stop without retry; unrelated host outbox work is left alone.
- Payload format 4 with backward reading of formats 1, 2, and 3. Preserve all
  checked-in legacy fixtures; they were captured from the earlier writers.

## Validation

Run `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, and
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`. The full suite includes
CoreCLR comparisons for nineteen guest cases, per-instruction checkpoint tests,
actual process kills, format upgrades, exact UTF-16 recovery, and stale writers.
All 77 tests pass. Eighteen effect tests cover intent, dispatch, and response/wakeup
crash windows with live CIL frames, per-instruction harness recovery, missing
receipt uncertainty, failed response rollback, malformed waiting continuations,
capability checks, legacy outbox upgrade, and linked-history retention after GC.
Twelve driver tests cover budget accounting, automatic delivery, first/second
submission and completion SIGKILL recovery, missing receipts, stale writers,
fault persistence, and CLI authorization and recovery. The full CLI harness
also runs end to end with `drive-local`.

On this host the shell may require `/Users/daeken/.cargo/bin/cargo` explicitly.
The .NET 10 SDK is needed for compiler fixtures. Restore itself does not need it.
Preserve unrelated working tree changes when continuing.

## Continuation and publishing

The current chat has an active follow-up every five minutes during initial
development. Each productive run should finish a coherent, verified change,
commit it, and push to origin. Push completed milestones frequently instead of
accumulating local changes. Check the current branch and remote state, do not
force-push, and preserve local commits if the remote is temporarily unavailable.

## Next implementation target

The bounded local driver and two-call crash-recovery proof are complete.
Prepare a structured model request and explicit durable provider binding before
adding a real adapter: identify the capability/model and preserve linked role/
content messages, so replay cannot silently use a different model or configuration.
Keep the deterministic local adapter and its crash tests as the first consumer;
arrays and generic collections need not block this work.

No real provider has been selected or connected. Obtain the user's choice when
ready to implement that adapter, and establish its actual receipt/idempotency
guarantees before permitting uncertain retry. Keep credentials outside managed
objects and keep host opt-in and limits independent of saved guest state.
Preserve atomic heap/code/frame/effect checkpoints, logical identities, and old
readers as representations expand. See [the current effect contract](effects.md).
